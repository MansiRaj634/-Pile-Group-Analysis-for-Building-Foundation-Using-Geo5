# -Pile-Group-Analysis-for-Building-Foundation-Using-Geo5
This project involves the design and analysis of a pile group foundation for a medium-rise building using Geo5 Pile Group software.

Pile Specifications:
Type of Pile: Reinforced concrete bored pile
Diameter of Pile (B): 0.6 m
Length of Pile: 12 m
Number of Piles in Group: 9 piles (arranged in a 3x3 grid)
Load on Pile Group:
Vertical Load (Total): 900 kN (total load from the building)
Lateral Load: 100 kN (wind load or seismic considerations)

Foundation Design Parameters:
Foundation Type: Pile group foundation, consisting of 9 bored cast-in-place piles arranged in a 3x3 grid.
Pile Diameter: 0.6 m
Pile Length: 12 m, extending into the third soil layer to ensure adequate load transfer and bearing capacity.
Pile Spacing: Center-to-center spacing of 2.0 m to minimize interaction effects between piles and maximize efficiency.
Pile Cap Thickness: 0.9 m, designed to distribute loads from the building effectively and maintain structural integrity.
Groundwater Table (GWT): Located at a depth of 3.0 m below the ground surface, ensuring the pile cap remains above the water table and minimizing buoyancy effects.

Analysis Approach:
Use of Geo5 Software: The project utilizes Geo5 Pile Group software to perform detailed analyses of the pile foundation, including:
Load Capacity Calculations: Estimation of skin friction and end-bearing capacity based on soil properties and pile dimensions.
Efficiency of Pile Group: Determining the efficiency of the pile group based on empirical formulas, with a target efficiency between 0.7 and 1.0.
Impact of Groundwater: Assessment of how the groundwater table depth influences effective stress in the soil and overall foundation performance.

This project provides a comprehensive framework for designing a pile group foundation for a medium-rise building, incorporating soil analysis, groundwater considerations, and structural design principles. By leveraging the capabilities of Geo5 Pile Group software, the design aims to achieve an effective and efficient foundation solution tailored to the specific site conditions and building requirements.

Analysis for a single pile for the same loading conditions, the load is factored accordingly i.e; dividing the 1200 kN over 9 piles udsing the software of Geo5 Pile. The following things mentioned are the results from the software. The whole analysis is done with the given particulars.

The above image shows how a single pile is safe in the bearing capacity analysis.

Upcoming image shows how a single pile will have settlement with the given load conditions.
