# -Pile-Group-Analysis-for-Building-Foundation-Using-Geo5
This project involves the design and analysis of a pile group foundation for a medium-rise building using Geo5 Pile Group software.

Pile Specifications:
Type of Pile: Reinforced concrete bored pile
Diameter of Pile (B): 0.6 m
Length of Pile: 12 m
Number of Piles in Group: 9 piles (arranged in a 3x3 grid)
Load on Pile Group:
Vertical Load (Total): 900 kN (total load from the building)
Lateral Load: 100 kN (wind load or seismic considerations)

Foundation Design Parameters:
Foundation Type: Pile group foundation, consisting of 9 bored cast-in-place piles arranged in a 3x3 grid.
Pile Diameter: 0.6 m
Pile Length: 12 m, extending into the third soil layer to ensure adequate load transfer and bearing capacity.
Pile Spacing: Center-to-center spacing of 2.0 m to minimize interaction effects between piles and maximize efficiency.
Pile Cap Thickness: 0.9 m, designed to distribute loads from the building effectively and maintain structural integrity.
Groundwater Table (GWT): Located at a depth of 3.0 m below the ground surface, ensuring the pile cap remains above the water table and minimizing buoyancy effects.

Analysis Approach:
Use of Geo5 Software: The project utilizes Geo5 Pile Group software to perform detailed analyses of the pile foundation, including:
Load Capacity Calculations: Estimation of skin friction and end-bearing capacity based on soil properties and pile dimensions.
Efficiency of Pile Group: Determining the efficiency of the pile group based on empirical formulas, with a target efficiency between 0.7 and 1.0.
Impact of Groundwater: Assessment of how the groundwater table depth influences effective stress in the soil and overall foundation performance.
